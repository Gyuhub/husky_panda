# Installation

## Getting h5pp
There are currently 4 ways to obtain `h5pp`:
* `git clone https://github.com/DavidAce/h5pp.git` and install (see below)
* From [conan-center](https://conan.io/center/h5pp/1.9.0)
* (Ubuntu/Debian only) Download the [latest release](https://github.com/DavidAce/h5pp/releases) and install with apt: `sudo apt install ./h5pp_<version>_amd64.deb`


## Requirements
* C++17 capable compiler. GCC version >= 7 or Clang version >= 7.0
* CMake version >= 3.15
* [**HDF5**](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/)  library, version >= 1.8

### Optional dependencies:
* [**Eigen**](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org): Write Eigen matrices and tensors directly. Tested with version >= 3.3.4
* [**spdlog**](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog): Enables logging for debug purposes. Tested with version >= 1.3.1
* [**fmt**](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt): String formatting library (used in `spdlog`).
* [**ghc::filesystem**](https://github.com/gulrak/filesystem): If your compiler lacks `std::filesystem` this drop-in replacement is downloaded at the configuration step if `H5PP_PACKAGE_MANAGER=cmake|fetch|conan`


**NOTE:** Logging works the same with or without [Spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) enabled. When Spdlog is *not* found,
a hand-crafted logger is used in its place to give identical output but without any performance
considerations (implemented with STL lists, strings and streams).


## Install methods

For full working examples see the directory [quickstart](https://github.com/DavidAce/h5pp/tree/master/quickstart). Find a summary below.

### Option 1: Copy the headers
Copy the files under `h5pp/source/include` and add `#include<h5pp/h5pp.h>`.
Make sure to compile with `-std=c++17 -lstdc++fs` and link the dependencies `HDF5`, `Eigen3`, `fmt`, and `spdlog`. The actual linking
is a non-trivial step, see [linking](#linking) below.


### Option 2: Install with Conan (Recommended)
Make sure to install and configure Conan first. You may need to add the line `compiler.cppstd=17` under `[settings]` in your conan profile `~/.conan/profile/default`.
Then run the following command:

```
$ conan install h5pp/1.9.0@ --build=missing
```

The flag `--build=missing` lets conan install dependencies: `HDF5`, `Eigen` and `fmt` and `spdlog`.

After this step, use `h5pp` like any other conan package.
For more information refer to the [conan docs](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) or have a look at [quickstart](https://github.com/DavidAce/h5pp/tree/master/quickstart).


### Option 3: Git clone + CMake install
After cloning this repository, build the library just as any CMake project. For example, run the following commands:

```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install-dir>  <source-dir>
    make
    make install
```

Headers will be installed under `<install-dir>/include` and config files under `<install-dir>/share/h5pp/cmake`.
These config files allow you to use`find_package(h5pp)` in your own projects, which in turn defines the target `h5pp::h5pp`
with everything you need to link `h5pp` correctly (including dependencies, if you so choose).

#### Opt-in automatic dependency installation with CMake
The CMake flag `H5PP_PACKAGE_MANAGER` controls the automated behavior for finding or installing dependencies. It can take one of these strings:

| Option | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `none`                            | Skip handling dependencies  |
| `find` **(default)**              | Use CMake's `find_package`  to find dependencies  |
| `cmake` **¹**                     | Use isolated CMake instances to download and install dependencies during configure. Disregards pre-installed dependencies on your system |
| `fetch` **²**                     | Use FetchContent to download and install dependencies. Disregards pre-installed dependencies on your system |
| `cpm` **³**                       | Use [https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake](CPM)to download and install dependencies. Disregards pre-installed dependencies on your system |
| `find-or-cmake`                   | Start with `find` and then go to `cmake` if not found |
| `find-or-fetch`                   | Start with `find` and then go to `fetch` if not found |
| `find-or-cpm`                     | Start with `find` and then go to `cpm` if not found   |
| `conan` **⁴**                     | Use the [Conan package manager](https://conan.io/) to download and install dependencies automatically. Disregards libraries elsewhere on your system  |

There are several variables you can pass to CMake to guide `find_package` calls and install location, see [CMake options](#cmake-options) below.

**¹** Dependencies are installed into `${H5PP_DEPS_INSTALL_DIR}[/<PackageName>]`, where `H5PP_DEPS_INSTALL_DIR` defaults to `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` and optionally `/<PackageName>` is added if `H5PP_PREFIX_ADD_PKGNAME=TRUE`

**²** Dependencies are installed into `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}[/<PackageName>]`.

**³** Dependencies are installed into `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}`.

**⁴** Conan is guided by `conanfile.txt` found in this project's root directory. This method requires conan to be installed prior (for instance through `pip`, `conda`, `apt`, etc). To let CMake find conan you have three options:
* Add Conan install (or bin) directory to the environment variable `PATH`.
* Export Conan install (or bin) directory in the environment variable `CONAN_PREFIX`, i.e. from command line: `export CONAN_PREFIX=<path-to-conan>`
* Give the variable `CONAN_PREFIX` directly to CMake, i.e. from command line: `cmake -DCONAN_PREFIX:PATH=<path-to-conan> ...`

### CMake options

The `cmake` step above takes several options, `cmake [-DOPTIONS=var] ../ `:

| Var | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `H5PP_ENABLE_EIGEN3`              | `OFF`                     | Enables `Eigen` linear algebra library support |
| `H5PP_ENABLE_FMT`                 | `OFF`                     | Enables `{fmt}` string formatting library |
| `H5PP_ENABLE_SPDLOG`              | `OFF`                     | Enables `spdlog` support for logging `h5pp` internal info to stdout (implies fmt) |
| `H5PP_PACKAGE_MANAGER`            | `find`                    | Download method for dependencies, select, `find`, `cmake`,`fetch`, `cpm`, `find-or-cmake`, `find-or-fetch` or `conan` |
| `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`               | `OFF`                     | Link dependencies with static or shared libraries    |
| `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`            | None                      | Install directory for `h5pp` and dependencies  |
| `H5PP_DEPS_INSTALL_DIR`           | `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`    | Install directory for dependencies only (if a different one is desired) |
| `H5PP_PREFIX_ADD_PKGNAME`         | `OFF`                     | Appends `<PackageName>` to install location of dependencies, i.e. `${H5PP_DEPS_INSTALL_DIR}/<PackageName>`. This allows simple removal |
| `H5PP_ENABLE_PCH`                 | `OFF`                     | Use precompiled headers to speed up compilation of tests and examples |
| `H5PP_ENABLE_CCACHE`              | `OFF`                     | Use ccache to speed up compilation of tests and examples |
| `H5PP_ENABLE_TESTS`               | `OFF`                     | Build tests (recommended!) |
| `H5PP_BUILD_EXAMPLES`             | `OFF`                     | Build example programs |
| `H5PP_IS_SUBPROJECT`              | `OFF`                     | Use `h5pp` with add_subdirectory(). Skips installation of targets if true. Automatic detection if not set |
| `H5PP_PRINT_INFO`                 | `OFF`                     | Print extra CMake info about the host and generated targets during configure |
| `CONAN_PREFIX`                    | None                      | conan install directory  |

In addition, variables such as [`<PackageName>_ROOT`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/PackageName_ROOT.html) and [`<PackageName>_DIR`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html) can be set to help guide CMake's `find_package` calls:


## Link to your project

### Link using CMake targets (easy)
`h5pp` is easily imported into your project using CMake's `find_package`. Just point it to the `h5pp` install directory.
When found, targets are made available to compile and link to dependencies correctly.
A minimal `CMakeLists.txt` to use `h5pp` would look like:


```cmake
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18)
    project(myProject)
    add_executable(myExecutable main.cpp)
    find_package(h5pp HINTS <h5pp-root-dir> REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(myExecutable PRIVATE h5pp::h5pp)
```


#### Targets explained

*  `h5pp::h5pp` is the main target including "everything" and should normally be the only target that you need -- headers,flags and (if enabled) the found/downloaded dependencies.
*  `h5pp::headers` links the `h5pp` headers only.
*  `h5pp::deps` collects targets to link all the dependencies that were found/downloaded when `h5pp` was installed. These can of course be used independently.
  * If `H5PP_PACKAGE_MANAGER==find|cmake|fetch|cmp` the targets are `Eigen3::Eigen`,`fmt::fmt`, `spdlog::spdlog` and `hdf5::all`,
  * If `H5PP_PACKAGE_MANAGER==conan` the targets are `CONAN_PKG::eigen`,`CONAN_PKG::fmt`, `CONAN_PKG::spdlog` and `CONAN_PKG::hdf5`.
*  `h5pp::flags` sets compile and linker flags to  enable C++17 and std::filesystem library, i.e. `-std=c++17` and `-lstdc++fs`.
   On `MSVC` it sets `/permissive-` to enable logical `and`/`or` in C++.


### Link manually (not as easy)
From the command-line you can of course link using linker flags such as `-std=c++17 -lstdc++fs -leigen3 -lfmt -lspdlog -lhdf5_hl -lhdf5` provided these flags make sense on your system.
You could also use CMake's `find_package(...)` mechanism. A minimal `CMakeLists.txt` could be something like:

```cmake
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18)
    project(myProject)
    
    add_executable(myExecutable main.cpp)
    target_include_directories(myExecutable PRIVATE <path-to-h5pp-headers>)
    # Setup h5pp
    target_compile_features(myExecutable PRIVATE cxx_std_17)
    target_link_libraries(myExecutable PRIVATE  stdc++fs) # To get <filesystem> headers working. Not needed after GCC 9.1 
    
    # CMake versions >= 3.19 bundle a good FindHDF5.cmake module to use with find_package
    find_package(HDF5 1.8 COMPONENTS C HL REQUIRED)  # Note that h5pp only needs the C libs of HDF5.
    target_link_libraries(myExecutable PRIVATE hdf5::hdf5_hl hdf5::hdf5) # *Should* take care of everything.
    # Otherwise HDF5 has to be linked manually. 
    # target_link_libraries(myExecutable PRIVATE hdf5_hl hdf5 rt dl m z pthread) # Possibly more libs, such as aec, dependending on your HDF5 installation
    # target_include_directories(myExecutable PRIVATE <path-to-HDF5-include-dir>)


    # The other dependencies lack find_package modules bundled with CMake, so this can be trickier.
    # You can
    #   1) Use find_package() to find installed packages in config-mode in your system
    #   2) Use find_library() + add_library() to find libfmt, libspdlog in your system.
    #   3) Just link -lfmt, -lspdlog and hope that these libraries are found by the linker.
    target_link_libraries(myExecutable PRIVATE spdlog fmt)
    target_include_directories(myExecutable PRIVATE <path-to-Eigen3-include-dir>)
    target_include_directories(myExecutable PRIVATE <path-to-fmt-include-dir>)
    target_include_directories(myExecutable PRIVATE <path-to-spdlog-include-dir>)



```

The difficult part is linking to HDF5 libraries and its dependencies.
#### Use the custom FindHDF5.cmake bundled with `h5pp`
When installing `h5pp`, finding HDF5 and setting up the CMake target `hdf5::all` for linking is handled by a custom module for finding HDF5, defined in `cmake/FindHDF5.cmake`.
This module wraps the default `FindHDF5.cmake` which comes with CMake and uses the same call signature, but fixes some annoyances with naming conventions in different versions of CMake and HDF5 executables.
It reads hints passed through CMake flags to find HDF5 somewhere on your system (can be installed via,`apt`,`yum`, `brew`, `Easybuild`, etc) and defines a CMake target `hdf5::all` with everything you need to link correctly.
Most importantly, it avoids injecting shared versions of libraries (dl, zlib, szip, aec) during static builds on older platforms.
You can use the custom module too. Add the path pointing to `FindHDF5.cmake` to the variable `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` from within your own project:

```cmake
    list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH path/to/h5pp/cmake/FindHDF5.cmake) # Replaces the bundled FindHDF5.cmake module
    find_package(HDF5 1.10 COMPONENTS C HL REQUIRED)
    if(TARGET hdf5::all)
            target_link_libraries(myExecutable PRIVATE hdf5::all)
    endif()
```

These are variables that can be used to guide the custom `FindHDF5.cmake` module:

| Var | Where | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`    | CMake     | List of directories where `CMake` should search for find-modules |
| `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`    | CMake     | List of directories where `find_package` should look for dependencies|
| `HDF5_ROOT`            | CMake/ENV | Path to HDF5 root install directory    |
| `HDF5_FIND_VERBOSE`    | CMake     | Prints more information about the search for HDF5. See also `HDF5_FIND_DEBUG` in the original module |
| `EBROOTHDF5`           | ENV       | Variable defined by Easybuild with `module load HDF5` |



## Uninstall

The target `uninstall` is defined by `h5pp` which removes installed headers and dependencies using their respective install manifests.
From the build directory, run the following in the command-line to uninstall:


```
    cmake --build .  --target uninstall
```
